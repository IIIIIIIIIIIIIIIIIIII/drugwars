Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up drugwars for local development.

1.  Fork the drugwars repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

        $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/drugwars.git

3.  Switch into the directory:

        $ cd drugwars/

4.  Create a branch for local development:

        $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5.  When you're done making changes, check that your changes build correctly:

        $ mvn package
        $ java -jar target/drugwars-0.0.2.jar

    This requires that you have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed.

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
        $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.rst.
2.  The pull request should work using both Maven and BlueJ.
